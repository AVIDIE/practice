Let me welcome you, ladies and gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment? Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock, gonna roll you, get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzamatazz you with a little bit of style
C'mon, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you, and I'll pill you, I'll Cruella DeVille you
And to thrill you, I'll use any device
